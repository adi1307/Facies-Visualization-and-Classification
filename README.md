# Facies-Visualization-and-Classification
A Deep Learning based Artificial Neural Network to classify Facies.

Facies is a body of a rock with specified characteristics, which can be any observable attribute of rocks (such as their overall appearance, composition or condition of formation), and the changes that may occur in those attributes over a geographic area. It is the sum total characteristics of a rock including its chemical, physical, and biological features that distinguishes it from adjacent rock.
Facies classification refers to assigning a rock type or a class to specific rock examples on the basis of measured rock properties. Classification of rocks is fundamental to geology and a variety of useful classification schemes may be employed, depending upon the circumstances. Rocks of the Council Grove Group fall into the large category of sedimentary rocks that, in this project, is subdivided intothe nine discrete facies (classes of rocks)as follows:
1.	Nonmarine sandstone ( SS )
2.	Nonmarine coarse siltstone ( CSiS )
3.	Nonmarine fine siltstone ( FSiS )
4.	Marine siltstone and shale ( SiSh )
5.	Mudstone (limestone) ( MS )
6.	Wackestone (limestone) ( WS )
7.	Dolomite ( D )
8.	Packstone-grainstone (limestone) ( PS )
9.	Phylloid-algal bafflestone (limestone) ( BS )

I have first visualized and then classified the facies.
